# What This Is
This repo is a collection of the late Aaron Swartz’s [blog posts](http://aaronsw.com/weblog). The contents are available in two formats:

- First, each post is available individually in Markdown, HTML, and PDF. These files are found in the post’s subdirectory under the `posts/` directory.
- Second, each post has been concatenated and nicely formatted into one big jumbo file, allowing you to read them as a book if you wish. They are in order from oldest to newest. That file is available in Markdown, PDF, and ePub; links are below.

## Download links
Download Aaron’s blog as one file: [Markdown](http://github.com/joshleitzel/rawthought/rawthought.md) | [PDF](http://github.com/joshleitzel/rawthought/rawthought.pdf) | [ePub](http://github.com/joshleitzel/rawthought/rawthought.epub)

## A Note on Production & Errata
Please note that, in the interest of getting this out there, most of these files were generated automatically with the use of Ruby scripts. All effort has been made to correct glaringly obvious formatting errors, but of course some will persist. For example, some images may be broken or malformatted in the output formats.

As ever, many eyes are better than one. Sit down and read through five random posts. Compare them to the original blog entries on the website (original links are included with each post); if you find errors, please fix them (in the Markdown in the post’s subdirectory) and submit a pull request. Alternatively, you can email me at joshleitzel@gmail.com.

Happy reading! This is my small [#pdftribute](http://pdftribute.net/) to Aaron.
